# Overview

This program was an ongoing attempt to further my knowlege of the Swift language. This is by no means a good example of what I know the language is capable of, but it is a starting point as I learn more about it. 

This is a simple program that runs in the terminal and displays random dad jokes. It also allows you to enter new ones, but it does not have the functionality to save them at this time.

# Development Environment

This was coded in Xcode 14.2. 

I have learned that there is much more reading, research, and practice that I need to do in order to get this program to the level of functionality that it could be useful for more than a couple of minutes of entertainment. This language provides enough support that I can, using the UI implementation, build apps for my watch, phone, tv, etc. By building these app I can further my understanding of the language and begin to build better and more complex programs that will be capable of better utilizing the strengths and power of the language.

# Future Work

- Implement a way to save user input jokes to be used again next time the program runs.
- Convert to a graphical app that can be used on multiple devices.
- Store the main collection of jokes outside of the program. Cloud database?
